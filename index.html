I wanted to learn more about Next JS, Typescript, Framer Motion and Tailwind and so I used my portfolio website as an opportunity to do this. The website was originally inspired by a YouTube video by Sonny Sangha, and over time has morphed into something I am quite proud of. The portfolio uses Sanity as backend, so that it can update the information without rebuilding the application. </p>

I therefore put a python script together which could do just that. After using it for a few races I found that it did help me with my team choice quite a bit and so I thought that others could possibly benefit from it too, and so I put a website together using Flask, HTML and CSS.</p>

This app was developed for a friend and owner of the Lucky Dice Coffee Company, based in Cape Town, South Africa. The main goal of the project was to build a cross platform application that retains customers by rewarding them for consecutive coffee purchases (effectively adding a time constraint to a traditional loyalty system).

The aim of this field of research is to bridge the gap between how humans and robots interact with their environment. ",

I wanted to learn more about Next JS, Typescript, Framer Motion and Tailwind and so I used my portfolio website as an opportunity to do this. The website was originally inspired by a YouTube video by Sonny Sangha, and over time has morphed into something I am quite proud of. The portfolio uses Sanity as backend, so that it can update the information without rebuilding the application. ",

I therefore put a python script together which could do just that. After using it for a few races I found that it did help me with my team choice quite a bit and so I thought that others could possibly benefit from it too, and so I put a website together using Flask, HTML and CSS.",
